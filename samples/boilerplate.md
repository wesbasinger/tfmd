This section can be used for a user facing description.  It is the only paragraph level element in Test Flavored Markdown.  All other elements are headings, lists or links.

## What are the basics of Markdown?

#### Hashes are headings.  The more hashes, the lower level the heading.

## What levels of headings does Test Flavored Markdown use?

#### In an effort to keep things simple this is the order of headings in Test Flavored Markdown.  One (1) hash indicates the title of the assessment.  Two (2) hashes indicate a question.  Three (3) hashes indicate an answer choice.  Four (4) hashes indicate the answer to the question directly above it.

##  What are the benefits of using Markdown?

#### Markdown has excellent documentation.  The link to the official site can be found [here](http://daringfireball.net).  Converting to HTML is trivial, and the Markdown syntax is incredibly simple, which allows you to focus on the content.
